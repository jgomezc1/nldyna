In a user element the physics per se is directly handle by the user which provides `NLDYNA` with the Jacobian matrix, residual vector and those variables which history are updated in each Newton iteration. Since the main program is unaware of the specific physics of the problem the variables are termed `State Variables`.\n",

During program execution the last converged value of the state variables vector is passed to the element subroutine where it is updated depending upon the increment of the problem primary variable.\n",

    "The concept of `State Variables`is briefly explained in terms of the simple example corresponding to a `type = 5` element corresponding to a Nonlinear - 1D Spring along the horizontal direction. The constitutive response of the spring is described by a bilinear isotropic hardening elasto-plastic model (Simo & Hughes, 1991.). In this problem the state variables are:\n",
